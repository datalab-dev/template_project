## File and Directory Structure

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Do not commit large files (> 1 MB) to the repository. Upload these to cloud
> storage (such as Google Drive or Box) instead.
>
> When you clone this repository, Git will not necessarily create directories
> that only contain large, untracked files (typically `data/` and `outputs/`).
> Instead you must manually create these directories and download their files
> from cloud storage.

```
data/           Data sets
docs/           Supporting documents
models/         Trained and serialized models
notebooks/      Notebooks (`.ipynb`, `.Rmd`, ...)
outputs/        Outputs from the code, including intermediate data sets

└── figures/    Graphics and figures to be used in reporting
src/            Python/Java/... (non-R) source code
